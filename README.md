## Bootstrap Jade Stylus Gulp Boilerplate

A minimal seed comprising of Bootstrap, Jade, Stylus, Gulp and some basic imports, like Google Webfonts, FontAwesome, etc. It has a set of configurations setup for the source and destinations paths, server port, livereloading, etc. You can leave them as they are or modify them inside of the `gulpfile.js`.

## Installation

You can simply fork and clone (or download) the repo into your local directory:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/FarhadG/bootstrap-jade-stylus-gulp-boilerplate.git
  $ cd bootstrap-jade-stylus-gulp-boilerplate
  $ npm install
  $ npm run start
```

## Usage

Once you run `$ npm run start`, it builds all of the files from `src` to `dist` folder, watches for changes and reloads your browser (on port 3000).

To simply build without watching, you can `$ npm run build`.

## Options

I'll be adding more features; that said, if you'd like a feature, let me know so that I'll try and implement it into future updates.
